# Foundation verification — 2026-10-27

Local environment: Node 24.14.0, pnpm 9.15.9; Astro 7.4.2, MDX 8.1.1,
React integration 7.1.1, React 19.3.1, TypeScript 6.0.3. Exact dependency graph is
in `pnpm-lock.yaml`. Versions and runtime compatibility were checked against
official docs and actual registry metadata; no invented package versions.

The learner attempt command, `pnpm lab:arrays`, is deliberately excluded from the
quality gate and is **not reported as passing**. Its starter functions are TODOs
for the learner. The same behavioral contracts are exercised against reference
solutions by `pnpm test`.

## Browser evidence

Playwright ran against production static preview at 1440 × 1000 and 390 × 664 CSS
pixels (mobile Chromium emulation), with extra 720px reflow checks. Verified:

- Home → path → Arrays → Hash Maps → previous lesson, plus TOC anchors.
- Exact insert-30-at-2 example, capacity doubling, individual shifts, final labels,
  deterministic reset and cell inspection using keyboard.
- Empty input/read error, insert into empty, insert at end, invalid index,
  update, append and removal.
- Native diagram buttons and SVG hotspots, keyboard activation and live feedback.
- Light/dark/system preference, persistence, live system change, blocked-storage
  fallback, reduced-motion preference and mobile Menu/Escape behavior.
- Concept search/no-results and quiz wrong/right/retry explanations.
- Reading the core lesson and recap with JavaScript disabled.
- Eight axe WCAG-tag scans (home/Arrays × light/dark × desktop/mobile), zero
  reported violations. Navigation flow reported no page errors or failed local requests.

Screenshots were inspected for desktop/mobile layout, dark/light readability,
legibility and the insertion result. This review found and corrected low contrast
in the selected preview label and syntax highlighting; code now uses Shiki high
contrast themes. Controls were moved above cells to improve mobile stepping.

Reproducible captures are generated under `test-results/`, including:

- `foundation-themes-persist--c1ef0-tion-narrow-layout-and-a11y-desktop/home-dark.png`

- `foundation-manual-insert-t-6f195-cessible-keyboard-selection-mobile/explorer-insert.png`

Generated screenshots/reports are ignored by Git; rerun the browser suite to
recreate them. No automatic visual-baseline acceptance was used.

## Limits and scope

Initial sandbox restrictions blocked npm DNS and preview startup; both were
resolved through approved tool permissions. No verification remains blocked.
The clean install reused package-store downloads; it was not a fresh OS image.
The GitHub Actions workflow is authored and hash-pinned but has not run remotely.
Real Safari/iOS devices, manual screen-reader evaluation and full WCAG conformance
are not claimed. The 720px check approximates layout reflow under desktop zoom;
it is not an actual browser zoom certification.

Only Arrays and Hash Maps exist. Their claims were checked against linked primary
sources and code examples executed, but owner pedagogical review remains required;
both retain draft status. No learner progress store, backend, runtime services,
offline cache, push, deployment, remote configuration change or license selection.

After owner review and independent practice, the next recommended single topic
is **two pointers**, extending the Arrays model with a focused invariant.
