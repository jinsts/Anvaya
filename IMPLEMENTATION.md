# Foundation implementation

Baseline: [ANVAYA_BOOTSTRAP.md](ANVAYA_BOOTSTRAP.md). Scope is Milestones 0–3;
only Arrays and the smaller Hash Maps sample. No remote changes or deployment.

- [x] **0 — Discover:** read baseline fully; inspect empty Git repository and tools;
      verify Astro prerequisites and package registry; record architecture decisions.
- [x] **1 — Foundation:** strict Astro/MDX, selective React, typed content/path data,
      responsive shell, theme, home/path/concept/lesson routes; check and build.
- [x] **2 — Teaching implementation:** Arrays, accessible diagram, step explorer, two tested labs,
      Hash Maps sample; browser interaction and visual verification.
- [x] **3 — Quality:** validators, unit/component/E2E tests, CI, authoring/design
      documentation, measured final verification.

Environment: Node 24.14.0 (LTS series), pnpm 9.15.9. Registry confirms Astro 7.4.2
requires Node >=22.23.4. Registry networking needs the approved pnpm escalation.
Exact dependencies are recorded in `pnpm-lock.yaml`. Lesson status stays draft
until owner review; automated checks do not certify conceptual mastery.

Milestone 1 checkpoint: `pnpm check` passed (0 errors/warnings, 2 deprecation hints),
`pnpm build` passed and validated all six pages and internal links/anchors.
TypeScript 6.0.3 selected because current Astro checker and typescript-eslint do
not support TypeScript 7 yet. Astro development telemetry disabled locally.

Milestones 2–3 implementation and local checks are complete. Final checks have
zero type errors, warnings or hints; 41 unit/component/reference-lab tests and
16 desktop/mobile browser tests pass. Eight light/dark home/Arrays accessibility
scans report no violations. See [verification evidence](docs/VERIFICATION.md).

Owner review of lesson concepts and independent exercise attempts remain open;
neither lesson is marked reviewed. Milestone 4 (progress, sync, full-text search,
offline support and private deployment) remains deferred. Next single lesson to
consider after studying these drafts: two pointers.

## Design and discovery refinement — 2026-10-28

Owner-approved follow-on: [ADR 0003](docs/adr/0003-subject-catalog-and-reference-design.md).

- [x] Replace the warm green/serif design with cool neutrals, blue accents,
      compact sans-serif type and coordinated light/dark teaching surfaces.
- [x] Implement Explore and subject overview using shared category/subject data.
- [x] Separate global discovery from contextual path sections and lesson outline.
- [x] Support standalone and shared lessons, preserving canonical URLs and an
      optional validated path context. Keep both existing lessons as drafts.
- [x] Finish integrated quality checks, browser review and verification evidence:
      50 unit/component tests, 28 desktop/mobile browser tests, 16 clean axe scans,
      type checks, lint, formatting, static build and internal-link validation.
      See [verification evidence](docs/VERIFICATION.md).

No additional curriculum, learner progress storage, services or remote changes
are part of this increment. Optional Milestone 4 remains deferred.

## Platform v2: scale, design, interview practice and authoring — 2026-10-28

Follows the owner-requested repository review. Decisions:
[ADR 0004](docs/adr/0004-content-collections-and-agent-authoring.md),
[ADR 0005](docs/adr/0005-interview-practice-and-local-progress.md) and
[ADR 0006](docs/adr/0006-design-system-and-search.md).

- [x] Commit the ADR 0003 increment as a baseline on branch `platform-v2`.
- [x] Fix the review's defects: lesson prose ran to ~115 characters per line;
      the sources note always said "draft"; `pnpm lab:arrays` would run every
      lab; the catalog was re-validated for every page; Home hard-coded the
      Arrays lesson and DSA path; navigation labels split titles on `:`; the
      complexity table was Arrays-only.
- [x] Move categories, subjects and paths to YAML collections. Add a trusted
      source registry, problem references, planned topics and cross-file
      validation.
- [x] Design system v2: self-hosted fonts, token scales with lint enforcement,
      Lucide icons, subject tones, dashboard, catalog, reading and practice
      page types.
- [x] Interview practice: lesson interview questions, 12 verified problem
      references, tracker with filters and statuses, mock interview timer,
      per-subject question drill, and local progress with export, import and clear.
- [x] Pagefind full-text search with section links.
- [x] Agent authoring: router `AGENTS.md`, six playbooks, authoring reference,
      templates, generators and `pnpm verify`.
- [x] Fix what a 3,000-lesson benchmark exposed: build validation now uses
      constant memory per page, and the drill has one page per subject.
- [x] Measured verification in [VERIFICATION.md](docs/VERIFICATION.md).

Both lessons remain drafts (`drafter: agent`). No new lesson was written; the
DSA path lists four planned topics taken from the bootstrap hierarchy (§3.1)
and the earlier recommendation of two pointers. No push, deployment, runtime
service, license or remote change.
